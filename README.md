# Parse HTML tables with rowspan and colspan attributes
In scouring the web, it was to the embarrasment of humanity that I could not find a parser 
that could accurately parse the tables found on Wikipedia - I thus wrote my own. 

In brief, some tables are not recorded/coded neatly where every row contains the same amount of columns.
Instead, these tables use attributes rowspan and colspan map out the table. These are neat but a pain to
scrape. Check out the corresponding notebook for the actual code.
