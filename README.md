# Parse HTML tables with rowspan and colspan attributes

In brief, some tables are not recorded/coded neatly where every row contains the same amount of columns.
Instead, these tables use attributes rowspan and colspan to map out the table. These are neat but a pain to
scrape. Check out the corresponding notebook for the code that processes these tables into
Pandas dataframes.
